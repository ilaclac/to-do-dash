## Hello,

thank you for taking the time and checking out this homework!

I've hosted the app on Vercel, you can take a look at:

### https://to-do-dash.vercel.app/

### Local environment setup

`npm install`

`npm run dev`

## Misc scripts:

TS check
`npm run tsc`

Eslint check
`npm run lint`

also, Prettier scripts, but those are not that important.

There is no .env, I didn't find a need for it.
Just npm install and run the project.

Sadly, there is also no tests of any kind, I hadn't had the time, sorry!
If I had to do it, I would use Vitest or Jest for FE testing and Cypress for E2E testing.
